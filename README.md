## about me

I am a software developer and freelancer based in Venezuela. I once pursued a degree in Computer Engineering but ultimately built my career independently. I am now interested in cybersecurity as the next step in my career. I am also deeply interested in hardware and would love to collaborate on embedded systems development. **Fun fact**: My passion for software engineering and technology began at the age of 9 when I hosted my own Habbo Hotel Retro server on a blog.
